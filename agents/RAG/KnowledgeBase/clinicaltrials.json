          "briefSummary": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in ventilated critically ill patients specially in intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased healthcare costs in China. However, VAP is preventable and many practices have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of this disease, but the morbidity is still so high. So much more methods of prevention should be needed to reduce the incidence of VAP.\n\nStatins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) present anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects besides their ability to regulate cholesterol composition. So it is hypothesized that early use of statin may prevent some of the infection disease such as VAP.\n\nActually, Two studies have showed that statin treatment is associated with reduced risk of pneumonia. However, the relationship between statins and reduced risk of pneumonia is not consistent.\n\nAfter reviewing some of the guidelines,meta analyses and system reviews, the investigator find that advanced age,immune suppression from disease or medication and specially depressed level of consciousness are the risk factors of VAP. So the investigator assumes that early use of statin may give us a favorable outcome in the patients with coma or in the patients with severe disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score \\\u003E 15 or Glasgow coma score \\\u003C 7).\n\nIn addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of statins in VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke. The investigator hopes that this study can approve the relationship between statins and reduced risk of VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke. And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical care as well.",
          "detailedDescription": "This is a one-center, two-arm, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. When a patient with ischemic stroke who needs mechanic ventilation is admitted to ICU,a sealed envelop will be opened which decide whether the patient is assigned to the placebo arm or the atorvastatin arm. During they stay in ICU, one tablet of atorvastatin (40mg) or one tablet of placebo will be administered. Atorvastatin or placebo will be administered through an enteral feeding tube or administered orally when patients are able to safely take oral medications.\n\nVAP diagnosis accords with the comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for ventilator-associated pneumonia:Diagnosis and treatment which was published in 2008."

          "detailedDescription": "Patients with coronary artery disease might benefit from successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there is currently no consensus on an optimal treatment modality for single lesions resulting in coronary total occlusion (CTO). Since the other coronary arteries are often lesion-free, or with stenosis of less than 50%, patients often present with no symptoms. Although the expert consensus on CTO lesion suggests reducing the incidence of long-term adverse events via successful revascularization, there are few retrospective studies on single CTO lesions. To date, it is unclear whether successful PCI based on optimal medication treatment (OMT) can increase myocardial viability and the extent of myocardial viability related to prognosis of those CTO patients. Therefore, the aim of this multi-center, prospective, open labeled, non-randomized controlled study was to determine if the improvement to myocardial viability in single CTO patients with successful PCI plus OMT was superior to that of patients with only OMT."

OPTIMIZE will be a prospective randomized trial that will enroll patients during pre-surgical testing before orthopedic surgery. This trial will investigate different strategies aimed at lowering cardiovascular events following orthopedic surgery. The study will compare an intensive multifactorial intervention comprising behavioral modification and polypharmacologic therapy aimed at several modifiable risk factors versus usual care. The trial hypothesis is that a personalized optimization approach is superior to usual care in reducing a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial necrosis, venous thromboembolism or thrombosis requiring reoperation at 30-days. Secondary endpoints include length of stay, major bleeding, each individual endpoint from the primary endpoint, and quality of life."

          "briefSummary": "Front-line clinicians cannot currently test for an individual participant whether symptoms experienced are the pharmacological result of a statin or due to other phenomena. In this trial, participants who have previously ceased statins due to side effects will be offered the opportunity to undergo twelve randomly ordered 1-month periods. There will be four periods of no medication, four periods of placebo and four periods of statin. The placebo and the statin pills will be identical in appearance. Participants will record on a daily basis side-effects experienced. At the end of the study, the one-month sessions are sorted into the order shown above. The participant can then observe directly how much of the increase in symptoms seen with statin is also seen with placebo.\n\n1. Hypothesis 1: that \\\u003E30% of participants enrolling for the study will complete it.\n2. Hypothesis 2: Overall \\\u003E50% of symptom burden is nocebo rather than pharmacological\n3. The investigators will define the Nocebo proportion of side effects.\n4. Hypothesis 3: that the majority of participants, at 6 months after completion, will either be taking statins or have declined statins for reasons other than perceived side effects.",
          "detailedDescription": "Participants: 50 participants will be recruited to the trial.\n\nMethod: At baseline each participant will have a detailed interview with the study doctor to assess past medical history and previous symptoms attributed to statins and assess if they are eligible to be enrolled. Eligible participants will be enrolled and allocated a random predefined order to take the study interventions in. These random codes will be generated by the trials unit statistician and supplied to the production pharmacy. The participant will be dispensed High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) containers which are in this pre-specified order. Each participant will receive 12 sets of HDPE containers pre-labelled. 4 sets of HDPE containers will contain no medication, 4 will contain 1-month supply of matched placebo and 4 will contain 1-month supply of atorvastatin 20mg. At the start of the next calendar month after the screening visit the participants will commence the trial intervention. The research nurse will call the participant to remind them to start on the 1st day of the next month after screening. Each day participants will rate their daily symptom on a phone application and will also complete 3 additional questionnaires on a monthly basis. The study nurse will call the participant at the end of each month to assess their progress in the trial. Each participant will return their boxes at dispensing visits (if applicable) and at the study end in order for a pill count to be undertaken to assess medication adherence. The placebo and atorvastatin pills will be visually identical.\n\nThe study enrols participants not intending to re-start clinical use of statins. Participants' other medications will continue to be managed as normal by their own physicians, with no restriction on starting, stopping or changing doses. For safety reasons the participant's own physician will be asked to consult the investigators prior to consideration of starting, or amending the dose of, any other lipid lowering medication.\n\nFor the trial, each participant will receive a smartphone, or if preferred, can have the application downloaded to their existing phone to allow real-time daily documentation of symptoms experienced on a visual analogue scale of 0-100. Participants will receive training on the simple touch-screen interface and a leaflet with further information will also be provided. Participants will rate symptoms every day, with the daily scores aggregated into a monthly score. This is preferable over scoring only once a month, because participants may struggle to remember and aggregate their symptom burden especially if it varies between days.\n\nEach month participants will fill out two validated questionnaires on the impact of their side-effects on their quality of life. These are EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L), a well-validated measure of health related quality of life, and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medicine (TSQM) questionnaire, a validated treatment satisfaction questionnaire. EQ-5D-3L assesses five domains of health and overall self-rated health using a visual analogue scale. EQ-5D-3L is conventional for assessing efficacy of medication on quality of life but may not be sufficient for assessing side effects, therefore the TSQM questionnaire will also be used. Use of both a health related quality of life questionnaire and a treatment satisfaction questionnaire will allow assessment of participants' multiple health states, overall self-rated health status and treatment satisfaction, and provide a test of both convergent validity and measurement invariance for the monthly aggregate symptom burden score.\n\nThe investigators will also ask participants to fill in a short questionnaire detailing any potentially their own physicians, with no restriction on starting, stopping or changing doses For safety reasons the participant's own physician will be asked to consult the investigators prior to consideration of starting, or amending the dose of, any other lipid lowering medication."

          "detailedDescription": "This is an open-labeled, randomized, two period, crossover, a single-center, full replicative, comparative, single-dose study, in which 50 healthy adult subjects will receive one of the study treatments during each study period.\n\nThe objective of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of two different formulations of atorvastatin after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions.\n\nSubject eligibility for this study will be determined at the screening visit and eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit at least 12 hours prior to drug administration for each study period.\n\nA subject who withdraws or is withdrawn during the pretrial evaluations but before receiving the first dose (the test or the reference product) in Period 1 will not be considered as a drop-out and will not be included in the final database. Standbys should be recruited and available to replace any subject who withdraws prior to the first drug administration. On-study drop-outs will not be replaced.\n\nEligible subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences. There will be two sequences in the study: TR and RT, where T = the test product, R = the reference product.\n\nFor each study period, subjects will receive a single 40 mg oral dose of atorvastatin (the test or the reference formulation). Study participants will be aware they will receive different formulations of the same drug, without being informed which product (Test or Reference) is being administered. For each subject, all scheduled postdose activities and assessments will be performed relative to the time of study drug administration.\n\nFasting will continue for at least 4 hours following drug administration, after which a standardized lunch will be served. Next meals will be provided for subjects in 6 hours, 9 hours and 12 hours after drug administration.\n\nWater will be provided as needed until 1 hour predose. Water will be allowed beginning 2 hours after the administration of the drug.\n\nA total of 23 blood samples will be collected (one tube of 6 mL each) in each study period for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments. The first blood sample will be collected prior to drug administration while the others will be collected up to 72 hours after drug administration.\n\nAtorvastatin plasma concentrations will be measured according to a validated bioanalytical method.\n\nSubjects are to be discharged from the clinic after the 24-hour following drug administration. However, they may be advised to stay at the clinical site for safety reasons, if judged necessary by the physician in charge. Subjects will return to the clinical site for each of the 3 remaining blood samples.\n\nStatistical analysis of all PK parameters will be based on an ANOVA model. Bioequivalence boundaries will be extended. The maximum extension range is 69.84%-143.19%. In order to expand the criterion of acceptability, it is necessary to confirm that the Cmax variability of the reference drug in the study actually exceeds 30%. Expansion of acceptable bioavailability limits based on intraindividual variability does not extend to AUC0-t, the limits of which, regardless of variability, should be limited to an interval of 80.00-125.00%. The duration of plasma sampling required by the protocol is expected to ensure that the condition \"AUC0-t is ≥ 80% of AUC0-∞\" is met.\n\nThe bioequivalence of the studied drugs will be confirmed for the parent substance, atorvastatin, and for its metabolites, orthohydroxyatorvastatin and parahydroxyatorvastatin."

          "briefSummary": "This project will evaluate the impact of L-Citrulline, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and atorvastatin administration on physical capacity and vascular function in Veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).",
          "detailedDescription": "The hospital admission rate for Veterans with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) continues to rise within the VA Health Care System, making HF the number one reason for hospital discharge Additionally, readmission rates of Veterans with HF tend to be higher than the national average, emphasizing the shortcomings of current therapeutic strategies Indeed, while optimized pharmacotherapy has led to a declining mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients, similar therapies in patients with HFpEF have been unsuccessful in altering the natural history of the disease Clearly, alternative therapeutic approaches are needed to improve outcomes in this ever-growing Veteran patient group.\n\nThe clinical presentation of HFpEF continues to be defined by dyspnea upon exertion and severe exercise intolerance symptoms that are unlikely due to a simple deficit in cardiac mechanics Indeed, the contribution of vascular dysfunction to exercise intolerance in patients with HFpEF has recently been identified highlighting the importance of disease-related changes in the peripheral circulation to HFpEG pathophysiology. While the mechanisms responsible for vascular dysfunction in HFpEF have not been established, there is an emerging concept that chronic inflammation and the associated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), stemming from HFpEF-associated comorbidities and inactivity, plays a crucial role. The proposed work seeks to address this important knowledge gap by examining the mechanisms linking inflammation, vascular health, and exercise tolerance in Veterans with HFpEF, and identifying which aspects of this cascade could be targeted to improve outcomes in this patient group.\n\nIn HFpEF, the peripheral vasculature represents an area that is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of circulating ROS due to the interaction with nitric oxide (NO). Indeed, following formation and release from the endothelium, the fate of NO is dictated to a large degree by the presence of ROS that catalyze the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-), thereby decreasing NO bioavailability. This deleterious effect on NO formation is amplified by ONOO--mediated oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), effectively \"uncoupling\" endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and thus further diminishing NO production. Bioavailability of NO may also be diminished through reductions in precursor (L-Arginine/L-Citrulline) availability, such that a \"substrate limitation\" may also be present in patients with HFpEF.\n\nWhile the potential of increased NO bioavailability to improve outcomes in patients with HFpEF has been increasingly recognized, results from clinical trials utilizing NO donors have been largely negative, suggesting a more comprehensive approach may be needed. Thus, the overall goal of the project is to evaluate the mechanisms responsible for vascular dysfunction and exercise intolerance in Veterans with HFpEF, which will be accomplished through selective pharmacologic targeting of distinct pathways known to regulate vascular NO signaling. The investigators have identified three discreet points in the cascade from inflammation to vascular dysfunction that may represent therapeutic targets for improving exercise tolerance in patients with HFpEF, and thus propose a series of integrative aims that will combine novel methodology with targeted pharmacologic interventions to selectively determine the importance of NO substrate, enzymatic cofactor bioavailability, and statin-induced mitigation of inflammation and ROS to disease-related changes in inflammation and NO signaling in HFpEF."

          "briefSummary": "The administration of antiretroviral drugs (ART) has significantly prolonged the life expectancy of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and delayed the progression towards Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). However, this has led to the emergence of other conditions, such as dyslipidemia, among individuals undergoing ART. Dyslipidemia is commonly managed with statin therapy, which has not been reported to have pharmacological interactions with ART. Additionally, ginkgo biloba extract (GBS) has been observed to improve blood lipid concentrations, and aerobic exercise training (EXA) interventions have shown positive modifications in these values.\n\nGiven this context, the present study aims to investigate the potential positive effects of an aerobic training program and the consumption of ginkgo biloba extract on plasma lipid concentrations in HIV-positive individuals. The study seeks to provide insights into novel strategies for managing dyslipidemia in this population."

          "briefSummary": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are high risk for death and cardiac disease is the major cause of death. CKD patients commonly have traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as age, gender, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Previous studies have reported that reducing cholesterol levels is associated with reducing morbidity and mortality from atherosclerosis. In particular, pharmacologic treatment using statin has been decreased the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in CKD population. Therefore, guidelines recommended the use of statin in CKD patients. On the other hands, niacin or fibrates is not recommended concomitantly with statins in patients with CKD because of increased risk of adverse events. In addition, recent study has reported that there was no incremental clinical benefit from the addition of niacin to statin therapy, in further decreasing the incidence of major cardiac events.\n\nSupplementation with omega-3 fatty acid (FA) lowers the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with myocardial infarction. This cardioprotective effect of omega-3 FA can be explained by anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, or anti-thrombic effects. In addition, omega-3 FA modulates cell membrane receptors and affects signal transduction and eicosanoid metabolism. The erythrocyte membrane content of FA has been shown to correlated with the FA content of the myocardium. The risk of cardiovascular disease is significantly reduced in patients with high omega-3 FA, such as eicosapentanoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the erythrocyte membrane. In contrast, high levels of erythrocyte membrane total trans-FA, trans-oleic acid, and arachidonic acid (AA) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Erythrocyte membrane monounsaturated FA (MUFA) content, including oleic acid, is significantly higher in patients with acute coronary syndrome than control subjects. The erythrocyte membrane oleic acid content was also higher in dialysis patients who have high risks of cardiovascular disease compared to control subjects. Therefore, the modification of erythrocyte membrane FA content is very important with respect to cardiovascular disease. In a previous study, erythrocyte membrane omega-3 FA was shown to be increased and the MUFA content was decreased after omega-3 FA supplementation in HD patients. However, there are no reports about the effect of statin on the erythrocyte membrane FA composition in CKD. Recent study has reported that those with pitavastatin 4mg were decreased DHA to AA ratio, but those with pravastatin 20 mg were not change the DHA to AA ratio in patient with CAD. Statin may have important role on the modulation of erythrocyte membrane FA. In this study, the investigators hypothesized that pitavastatin supplementation can modify erythrocyte membrane FA content, including MUFA and oleic acid, in CKD patients. In addition, the investigators evaluated the effect of pitavastatin on adiponectin and glucose level in CKD patients."

          "briefSummary": "This study will compare atorvastatin (Lipitor) with a placebo (inactive pill) to see if this drug reduces heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) or lung inflammation after thoracic surgery. Preliminary results suggest that cholesterol lowering drugs (statins) may reduce problems after surgery such as arrhythmias or lung inflammation which may be serious. This study will be randomized and double blind, meaning that patients are placed in groups purely by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the patient or doctor will know which group the patient is in.",
          "detailedDescription": "Hypothesis: Statins attenuate perioperative inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and severity of cardiopulmonary complications after thoracic surgery.\n\nAim 1. To determine whether prophylactic administration of atorvastatin attenuates the inflammatory and oxidative response to surgery and significantly reduces the composite risk of cardiovascular morbidity (atrial fibrillation (AF), acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), pulmonary embolism) and mortality within 30 days after thoracic surgery.\n\nAim 2. To explore whether prophylactic administration of atorvastatin attenuates the inflammatory and oxidative (CRP, IL-6, TNF, and MPO) response to surgery and significantly reduces the overall risk of pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, acute respiratory failure) after thoracic surgery.\n\nAim 3. To explore the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) changes in genes linked to atrial fibrillation and inflammatory markers and development of pulmonary morbidity after thoracic surgery.\n\nAim 4. To explore whether an imbalance between metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and its inhibitor (TIMP) is associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation risk and/or development of pulmonary morbidity after thoracic surgery."

          "detailedDescription": "Atherosclerotic lower extremity PAD affects more than 20 million people in the world. PAD is associated with a major decline in functional status and claudication is the most frequent symptom. Current claudication therapies are associated with significant limitations. Pharmacotherapy cilostazol and supervised exercise are recommended in 2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the management of lower extremity PAD patients with claudication, but cilostazol may not achieve an ideal response rate, and supervised exercise efficacy may be limited by co-morbidities and medicare reimburse. Furthermore endovascular procedure may not be feasible, durable or cost-effective, especially in femoropopliteal arteries.\n\nThe aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that SDT improves PWT by inhibiting atherosclerotic plaques inflammation in femoropopliteal arteries PAD patients compared to optimal medical care (OMC) within 6 month. An estimated 80 eligible patients will be randomly divided into tow groups: OMC and SDT combined with OMC. Recruitment will be performed over 6 months and patients will be followed for 6 months; the anticipated total study duration will be 2 years.\n\nFinally, this trial investigate the safety and efficacy of SDT in PAD patients with intermittent claudication and explore new end-points to evaluate therapeutic effects using PET-CT imaging as well as traditional endpoints."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this application is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin as a potential treatment to preserve beta cell function in children and young adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1DM).",
          "detailedDescription": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. T1DM therapy requires insulin administration, either by multiple daily injections or by insulin pump. However, in many patients, blood sugar control remains suboptimal and complications develop that shorten life expectancy and severely impact quality of life. At the time of diagnosis, most patients still have significant residual beta cell function. Previous research has shown that weakening the immune system's attack on the pancreatic beta cells may help to preserve or potentially increase insulin production.\n\nPreliminary studies have shown that members of the statin family of medications, including atorvastatin (Lipitor®), preserve beta cell function in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. These finding suggest that use of atorvastatin in combination with insulin therapy may delay and potentially reverse the destruction of beta cells in patients who have recently developed type 1 diabetes. Atorvastatin (Lipitor®) is approved for use in adults and children (\\\u003E10 years of age) who have elevated blood cholesterol levels. This study will examine whether atorvastatin (Lipitor®) may also help the body preserve insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed (within 8 weeks) type 1 diabetes.\n\nPatients will be randomly assigned to take either atorvastatin (Lipitor®) or placebo. Two out of every 3 patients will receive atorvastatin and 1 out of 3 will get placebo. As this is a double-blinded study, neither the care team nor the patient will know if they are actually taking atorvastatin (Lipitor®). Patients who have given consent to participate in the study and pass the required screening tests will take the assigned treatment every day for 12 months. All patients will begin taking 10 mg once daily, the recommended starting dose. After 4 weeks, the dose will be increased to 20 mg. In addition to a high standard of diabetes care and the medication, patients will have blood tests during 7 visits over an 18 month period."

In a recent study the investigators have shown that high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) is higher in SLE patients with (versus without) coronary calcium, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. In an ongoing two year intervention trial of atorvastatin, the investigators will determine if statins retard coronary calcium and reduce hs-CRP. However, 10% of the patients in the trial were intolerant of statins. The investigators want to now investigate whether there are additional, and potentially safer ways, to reduce hs-CRP in SLE. In this study, the investigators will determine if doxycycline reduces hs-CRP and other vascular inflammatory markers including interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), soluble inter cell adhesion molecule (s-ICAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in SLE."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of Atorvastatin treatment on the NO-system measuring renal and cardiovascular variables in patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy.",
          "detailedDescription": "Subjects will be examined on two examination days. 4 days prior to each examination day subjects are treated with either atorvastatin or placebo. During treatment periods subject are given a standardized diet.\n\nOn the examination days subject are given L-NMMA(L-NG-monomethyl Arginine citrate), a NO inhibitor, 6 mg bolus infusion followed by continuous 4 mg/kg/hr infusion for 1 hour. Renal function, central hemodynamic and vasoactive hormones are evaluated prior, during and after L-NMMA infusion.\n\nRenal function is measured by renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and urinary sodium, potassium and albumin concentration. Urinary excretion of protein from sodium channels such as the NaCl cotransporter (NCC), the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) will be measured to evaluate channel activity in the nephron.\n\nCentral blood pressure, pulse wave analysis, and augmentation index are measured using SphygmoCor® from Atcor."

Upon meeting the inclusion criteria and providing informed consent, each participant will complete a battery measure of neuropsychological tests, blood sample collection, and magnetic resonance imaging scan after enrollment and after 1- and 2-years follow-up.\n\nAbout 100 participants were included in this study. A series of neuropsychological tests were obtained by a trained investigator to assess. The tests include the evaluation of global cognitive function and multiple individual cognitive domains. The various tasks and questionnaires to measure cognition function including Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA), Mini Mental State Examination(MMSE), Chinese Auditory Verbal Learning Test(CAVLT), Digital Span Test(DST), Symbol digital modalities test(SDMT), Stroop color test(Stroop test), Color trail test(CTT), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure(ROCF), Judgment of Line Orientation (JoLO), Verbal Fluency Test(VFT), Boston Naming Test (BNT) , Lateralized attention network test(LANT) etc, at the same time, the investigators also pay attention to the evaluation of participants' emotions by Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAMA),Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD). Furthermore, the memory as the primary outcome measure, this study focused on the immediate memory, delayed memory and recognition memory of patients with asymptomatic ICAS. Blood sample will be collected for biological multiomics research. The patients will receive a magnetic resonance imaging scan in multi-modalities.\n\nAfter 1 and 2 years follow-up,the participants will be interviewed to obtain the same assessments, blood sample and magnetic resonance imaging scan in multi-modalities as before."

          "briefSummary": "This research evaluates the effects of a cholesterol-lowering medication, atorvastatin, on both arthritis activity and the ability of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, sometimes referred to as \"good cholesterol\") to prevent changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), which lead to atherosclerosis, or \"hardening of the arteries.\" We hypothesize that atorvastatin may improve both joint inflammation and the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL cholesterol.",
          "detailedDescription": "Heart attacks are the leading cause of death in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Cardiovascular events occur more frequently than would be expected in patients with RA and traditional heart risk factors do not explain this increased risk. Further research is needed to pursue ways of reducing heart disease mortality and improving outcome in patients with RA.\n\nThere is reason to believe that a class of cholesterol-lowering medications called statins, beneficial in cardiovascular disease prevention, may be able to reduce the irritation of the joints (\"inflammation\") associated with RA. Statins have been shown to reduce manifestations of inflammation in the blood of patients at increased risk for heart disease, and in the process reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and sudden death. Some similarities in the nature of both RA and heart disease may suggest potential benefits of statin therapy in both conditions.\n\nIn addition to inflammation, another factor which may contribute to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in RA patients is dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, sometimes referred to as \"good cholesterol\"). Normally, HDL-C acts to counter a type of damage called \"oxidation\" within LDL-C which is a critical step in the development and progression of heart disease. Data from patients with RA and system lupus erythematosus (SLE) suggests that patients with active rheumatic diseases such as RA and SLE may have increased amounts of dysfunctional HDL-C, and therefore they may be at increased risk of heart disease. A blood test developed by Dr. Navab and colleagues at UCLA rapidly assesses this HDL-C function. This study will investigate both the level of HDL-C antioxidant function in patients with active RA as well as whether abnormal HDL function can be improved by statin use in this population. This research also evaluates the effects of atorvastatin on arthritis activity. We hypothesize that atorvastatin may improve both joint inflammation and the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL cholesterol."

These problems markedly affect length and quality of life and cost a lot to treat. Treatments are known that can prevent development of advanced kidney and heart disease. These treatments are not being optimally applied in the current health system. This study aims to identify people with relatively early stage chronic kidney disease. With the participation of these people, the study will test whether a nurse coordinated clinic involving a medical kidney specialist, applying the known treatments, can reduce or delay the onset of advanced kidney disease and heart and blood vessel problems such as heart attack, stroke and death, to a greater extent than usual care. The study will also address issues of costs associated with care and illness. The nature of the care provided by the health care professionals will be studied to see how best to achieve good health outcomes.",
          "detailedDescription": "The pilot study is designed in two phases. The first phase is intended to provide data on some key points that need to be addressed prior to future funding applications to the CIHR and the NHLBI. These applications are currently tentatively planned for the fall of 2005. The second phase of the pilot study is intended to more completely establish the feasibility of successfully completing the full trial by examining the issue of contamination and the ability of the intervention to generate a difference between the groups with regard to use of efficacious therapies and control of modifiable risk factors, or intermediate variables on the causal pathway to the clinical end-points in the full-scale trial. The second phase will also address the need to describe the operation of the experimental intervention more thoroughly. Finally, the second phase of the pilot study will compare the randomized study groups with regard to short-term quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nPhase1\n\n1. How long does it take to recruit 100 patients per study site?\n2. What recruitment strategies are most efficient?\n3. How do the baseline characteristics of those recruited compare to referred populations, and to the general population with CKD?\n4. How do the nephrologist and nurse work together to provide care to those in the intervention group?\n5. What is the nature of the care provided by the nurses and physicians to those in the intervention group?\n6. Is the study nurse able to manage the patient load?\n7. How much time and resources are needed to a) provide care, b) to carry out study measurements?\n8. Can health care resources used be measured for economic analysis?\n\nPhase II\n\n1. What is the rate of loss to follow-up?\n2. What is the overall estimate of the primary outcome event rate?\n3. By one year of follow-up, what is the difference between the study groups in terms of:\n\n   1. Protocol interventions used (estimates contamination)\n   2. Proportion i) smoking; and proportion achieving ii) BP, iii) lipid, iv) diabetes, v) anemia, vi) acidosis, vii) mineral metabolism targets\n   3. Quality of Life\n   4. Satisfaction with care Randomized, parallel, two group, multicentre, clinical trial of people with CKD, with or without diabetes mellitus or proteinuria. The intention is to roll the pilot study into the full-scale trial if the pilot itself is deemed successful. A laboratory-based case finding method will be used preferentially to identify potential participants. This will be supplemented by practice-based case-finding approaches where necessary to ensure recruitment of a representative population. Randomization will be by a central computer-based telephone process. Stratification will be by center and presence of diabetes and proteinuria. The intervention consists of a protocol guided, multiple risk factor and chronic disease care model-like approach delivered by a trained nurse supported by a nephrologist and will be based in a nephrology clinic like setting."

The Aim of this study is to 1) Evaluate the association between moderate to severe psoriatic disease and measures of vascular function. 2) Evaluate the association between moderate to severe psoriatic disease and measures of thrombotic risk. 3) Understand how traditional medications used in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention such as aspirin and statins affect vascular function and thrombotic risk in those with moderate to severe psoriatic disease.",
          "detailedDescription": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the US. Five modifiable risk factors: smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension and obesity, account for 50% of CVD mortality between the ages of 45 - 79.1 These traditional cardiac risk factors dictate who to treat with primary prevention measures but do not take into account patient-specific disease states such as psoriatic disease including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which predispose to chronic inflammation. Patients with psoriatic disease have an increased risk of atherosclerotic heart disease and myocardial infarctions compared to matched controls."

Plasma hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitory activity after a single dose of atorvastatin or simvastatin, either alone or in combination with TMC435 will be also evaluated.",
          "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I, 2-panel, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study in healthy participants to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between TMC435 and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and simvastatin. The study consists of a screening period (21 days prior to the first intake of study medication), a 17-day treatment period and a 5-7 days follow-up period. Approximately thirty six healthy participants will be equally divided to 2 panels (n=18 per panel). Within each panel all participants will receive the same treatments in the same order. In Panel 1, each participant will be administered a single oral 40-mg atorvastatin dose on Day 1 and Day 13. The participants will receive TMC435 at a dose of 150 mg once daily from Day 4 until Day 15. In Panel 2, each participant will be administered a single oral 40-mg simvastatin dose on Day 1 and Day 13. TMC435 at a dose of 150 mg will be administered once daily from Day 4 until Day 15. Treatment duration (including Day -1) will be 17 days for both panels (Panel 1 and Panel 2). Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study."

A therapy that lowers the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis would seem to be a reasonable approach to managing this disease, for which there is currently no treatment.\n\nATORVO is a randomized double-masked clinical trial comparing a daily dose of 80 mg of atorvastatin to matched placebo in persons recently diagnosed with RVO. At 24 weeks after randomization, we will evaluate each participant's visual acuity and the presence of secondary complications related to RVO."

          "briefSummary": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is the most common treatable genetic disorder for which a simple, effective treatment is available, with few side effects.\n\nIt leads to a significant increase in LDL levels, generally in excess of 1.9g/l, including in children. It is much higher than the values usually found in secondary or polygenic hypercholesterolemia. This condition multiplies the cardiovascular risk in adulthood by a factor of 13, and is responsible for 6,500 early cardiovascular events per year. In the absence of treatment, the state of the arteries of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, at the age of 40, would be equivalent to that of 80-year-olds.\n\nCurrently, the prevalence is estimated at 1 in 300 people in France. However, this prevalence is largely underestimated, as targeted screening is rarely carried out, and it is estimated that only 10% of sufferers are diagnosed in France, and only 5% of affected children are known and treated.\n\nToday, according to the French health authority, the indications for screening children are: a history of an early vascular event in one of the two parents, or familial hypercholesterolemia in a first-degree relative.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization and numerous studies recommend extending screening to the general population. Screening all children and teenagers could make it possible to introduce healthy dietary habits at an early stage, to better adapt the choice of contraception in young women, to treat before the first symptoms appear and thus reduce mortality in adulthood by up to 48%, and to screen relatives who have not yet had a cardiovascular event.\n\nIn Slovenia, 90% of children have had a lipid panel since 1994, significantly reducing mortality. In the United Kingdom, the lipid check-up, offered as part of a compulsory visit at the age of two, is being rolled out: 90% of families naturally take it up on the recommendation of their doctors.\n\nThe treatment of hypercholesterolemia is simple, and relies first and foremost on hygienic dietary rules and treatments such as statins and Liptruzet (a combination of atorvastatin and ezetimibe), treatments that are easily accessible, effective, with few side effects and low cost."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is:\n\n1. To assess the efficacy of a lipid-lowering agent (atorvastatin) on the development of atherosclerosis that predisposes children with SLE to cardiovascular events in adulthood.\n2. To assess the safety of intermediate-term (36 months) treatment of children and young adults with atorvastatin.\n3. To further characterize the course of SLE in children and young adults, by establishing a cohort of pediatric SLE patients to be followed prospectively.\n4. To establish a mechanism for conducting clinical trials in rare pediatric rheumatic diseases using the Children's Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA).",
          "detailedDescription": "Children and adolescents with SLE represent 15% of all SLE patients. Children with SLE suffer high morbidity that affects many organ systems, reduces their quality of life, and shortens their lifespan. As more children with SLE survive into adulthood, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has emerged as a major concern. SLE is a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction and death in young premenopausal women with SLE, even after controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Acceleration of atherogenesis in SLE most likely reflects SLE-associated vascular immune and inflammatory changes.\n\nAlthough limited, the data on cardiovascular and lipid abnormalities in children with SLE implicate atherosclerosis as an important cause of long-term morbidity and mortality. The 3-hydroxy-3-methlglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, reduce mortality and morbidity from atherosclerosis in adults and have intrinsic anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory properties. These anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory activities may have particular benefit in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis in SLE. This trial will evaluate atorvastatin in children with SLE in the largest cohort of pediatric SLE patients ever studied prospectively.\n\nChildren in this study will be randomized to receive either atorvastatin or a placebo. All children will be followed for 3 years, during which they will have 15 study visits. Study visits will generally last 2 hours and will include medical interview, medication review and pill count, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Cardiovascular-specific outcome measures will include assessments of high sensitivity CRP; fasting lipid profile; homocysteine level; apolipoprotein A, B1, and Lp(a); carotid intima media thickness (IMT); and tensor diffusion/MRI."

          "briefSummary": "This is a prospective cohort study to investigate the early impact of evolocumab on patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in China. Evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin taye 9 inhibitor, can significantly reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and has a positive effect on improving cardiovascular events. However, existing studies have focused almost exclusively on the long-term effects of Evolocumab, and the early effects of Evolocumab on AIS patients remains unclear.",
          "detailedDescription": "Patients aged 18-80 years old admitted to the Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, with a definite diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and receiving lipid-lowering therapy with statins with or without evolocumab will be included in this study. Participants will be divided into two groups according to the lipid-lowering therapy they used: 1) statin-alone group: the participants receive statins alone (atorvastatin 20mg qn or rosuvastatin 10mg qn or pivastatin 2mg qn) for lipid reduction, and 2) PCSK9-i group: the participants receive statins (atorvastatin 20mg qn or rosuvastatin 10mg qn or pivastatin 2mg qn) and evolocumab (140mg twice a month) for lipid reduction. Most importantly, the lipid-lowering therapy of participants will be decided only by clinicians not involved in the study, not by the investigators. The levels of blood lipid (TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, Apo AI and Apo B) and inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP and IL-6) of these participants at different time points (day 1, day 3, day 5, and month 3) will be recorded. The target level of LDL-C is the LDL-C reduction ≥50% from the baseline and LDL-C\\\u003C1.4mmol/L (55mg/dL). In addition, the cardiovascular events and adverse drug reactions of these participants during follow-up will also be recorded. During the follow-up period (3 months), participants who changed their lipid-lowering regimen, including the type, dosage and frequency of statins and evolocumab, will be excluded from the study."

  "data": "Based on the provided context, here is a detailed clinical trials report for Atorvastatin:\n\n**Clinical Trials Report for Atorvastatin**\n\n**User Query Context: \"How useful is Atorvastatin in cardiovascular diseases?\"**\n\nBased solely on the provided context, the usefulness of Atorvastatin in cardiovascular diseases cannot be fully assessed. Two trials in the context relate to cardiovascular aspects:\n\n1.  **NCT00640549 (ALPIN Study)** aimed to investigate the effects of atorvastatin on LDL and HDL subfractions in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, both significant cardiovascular risk factors. However, this study was **terminated prematurely** due to a higher screening failure rate, with no safety or efficacy reasons involved in the decision. Therefore, no results on Atorvastatin's usefulness from this trial are available in the context.\n2.  **NCT00375518** studied Atorvastatin versus placebo to reduce cardiopulmonary complications (heart rhythm abnormalities or lung inflammation) after thoracic surgery. While related to cardiac and pulmonary health, this trial focuses on perioperative prophylaxis rather than the direct long-term treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease itself. This study was **completed**, but its results regarding the reduction of complications are **not provided** in the context.\n\nThe third identified trial (Trial X, without an NCT ID) primarily investigates patient-reported symptoms and perceived side effects in individuals who had previously withdrawn from statins, focusing on statin intolerance rather than the direct efficacy of Atorvastatin for cardiovascular disease.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Report:**\n\n**1. Total Trials:**\nThere are **3 distinct clinical trials** involving Atorvastatin mentioned in the provided context:\n*   One trial focusing on symptom scores for statin intolerance (referred to as \"Trial X\" as no NCT ID is provided).\n*   NCT00640549: \"Atorvastatin and LDL Profile in Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (ALPIN Study)\"\n*   NCT00375518: \"Study of Atorvastatin Versus Placebo to Reduce Cardiopulmonary Complications After Thoracic Surgery\"\n\n**2. Phase Distribution:**\n*   **Phase 4:** 1 trial (NCT00640549)\n*   **Not specified:** 2 trials (Trial X, NCT00375518)\n\n**3. Status Distribution:**\n*   **TERMINATED:** 1 trial (NCT00640549)\n*   **COMPLETED:** 1 trial (NCT00375518)\n*   **Not specified:** 1 trial (Trial X)\n\n**4. Top 5 Sponsors:**\nOnly 2 unique sponsors are identified in the provided context:\n1.  Pfizer's Upjohn (merged with Mylan to form Viatris Inc.) / Pfizer (for NCT00640549)\n2.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (for NCT00375518)\n\n**5. Trend Over Years:**\nThe context provides start and completion dates for two trials:\n*   **NCT00640549:** Started March 2003, Completed October 2004.\n*   **NCT00375518:** Started July 2006, Completed May 2014.\nWith only two trials having date information, it is not possible to establish a significant \"trend over years\" in Atorvastatin clinical trials from the given context.\n\n**6. Top Countries:**\nCountry information for the trials is **not available** in the provided context.\n\n**7. Enrollment Analysis:**\n*   **NCT00640549:** 41 participants (Actual enrollment)\n*   **Trial X:** Enrollment count is **not available** in the provided context.\n*   **NCT00375518:** Enrollment count is **not available** in the provided context.\n\n**8. Clinical Landscape Summary:**\nThe Atorvastatin trials described in the context cover diverse areas:\n*   **Statin Intolerance (Trial X):** This trial investigates the subjective experience of side effects attributed to statins. Its primary outcome is \"Mean Symptom Scores Across Statin, Placebo and no Treatment Periods\" for patients who previously withdrew from statins due to perceived side effects. This addresses an important clinical challenge of statin adherence.\n*   **Lipid Profile in Diabetes/Hyperlipidemia (NCT00640549 - ALPIN Study):** This Phase 4 study aimed to understand Atorvastatin's impact on LDL and HDL subfractions in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The study was terminated prematurely before reaching completion.\n*   **Cardiopulmonary Complications after Thoracic Surgery (NCT00375518):** This double-blind, placebo-controlled study explored whether Atorvastatin could reduce heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) or lung inflammation following thoracic surgery.\n\nOverall, the context reveals Atorvastatin being studied for patient-reported side effects, lipid management in high-risk populations, and perioperative complication reduction. However, no efficacy or outcome results are provided for any of these trials in the given text."

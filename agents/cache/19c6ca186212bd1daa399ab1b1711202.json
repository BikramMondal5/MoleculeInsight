(1 patent: \"Desolvation process for the production of atorvastatin hemi-calcium essentially free of bound organic solvent\", patent ID \"7122681\")\n*   Lifecycle Pharma A/S (1 patent: \"Stabilized atorvastatin\", patent ID \"7772273\")\n*   WARNER-LAMBERT COMPANY LLC (1 patent: \"Pharmaceutical compositions of atorvastatin\", patent ID \"7790197\")\n*   Avecia Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (1 patent: \"Process and intermediate compounds useful in the preparation of statins, particularly atorvastatin\", patent ID \"7414141\")\n\n**3. Top Inventor Countries**\n*   **Canada (CA)**: Inventors are listed for 2 patents (Apotex Pharmachem Inc. patents).\n*   Israel (IL): Inventors are listed for 1 patent (TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD. patent).\n*   Denmark (DK): An inventor is listed for 1 patent (Lifecycle Pharma A/S patent).\n*   United States (US): Inventors are listed for 1 patent (WARNER-LAMBERT COMPANY LLC patent).\n*   Great Britain (GB): Inventors are listed for 1 patent (Avecia Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. patent).\n*   Slovenia (SI): An inventor (Gorazd Sorsak) is listed in the initial, unidentified patent data block.\n\n**4. Key CPC Technology Classes**\nThe key Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) classes and groups reveal the technological focus:\n*   **C07 (Organic Chemistry):** This class, particularly **C07D207:34** (Heterocyclic compounds; Saturated five-membered rings with one nitrogen atom as the only ring hetero atom), is prominent across patents related to the preparation of Atorvastatin and its intermediates. Other C07D groups (e.g., C07D207:416, C07D405:06, C07D309:10, C07D309:30) are also present, indicating various chemical synthesis aspects.\n*   **A61 (Medical or Veterinary Science; Hygiene):**\n    *   **A61P (Specific therapeutic activity):** Key groups include **A61P3:06** (Drugs for disorders of lipid metabolism) and **A61P7:00** (Drugs for affecting the heart or vascular system), directly indicating the therapeutic applications of Atorvastatin.\n    *   **A61K (Preparations for medical purposes):** Several groups like A61K9:209, A61K9:1617, A61K9:1623, A61K9:1652, A61K9:2013, A61K9:2018, A61K9:2054, A61K9:2077, A61K9:2846, A61K9:2866 indicate a focus on various pharmaceutical forms and dosage specifics. Groups like A61K31:40 (Medicinal preparations containing heterocyclic compounds with one nitrogen atom as the only ring hetero atom) relate to the chemical nature of Atorvastatin as an active ingredient.\n*   **Y02 (Technologies for climate change mitigation):** The group **Y02P20:55** (Processes for the production of organic compounds with reduced environmental impact) appears in some patents, suggesting an interest in sustainable or \"green\" chemical processes for Atorvastatin.\n\n**5. Filing Trends Over Years**\nThe patents in this dataset show activity in the following years:\n*   **2006:** 2 patents (\"7112604\", \"7122681\")\n*   **2008:** 2 patents (\"7414141\", \"7429613\")\n*   **2010:** 2 patents (\"7772273\", \"7790197\")\n\n**6. Patent Landscape Summary**\n\nThe patent landscape for Atorvastatin, as depicted in the provided context, highlights innovation primarily in its **chemical synthesis and intermediate compounds**, its **pharmaceutical compositions and stabilization**, and its **therapeutic applications**.\n\n*   **How useful is Atorvastatin in cardiovascular diseases?**\n    The context directly supports Atorvastatin's usefulness in cardiovascular diseases through its CPC classifications. Specifically, the presence of **A61P3:06** (\"Drugs for disorders of lipid metabolism\") and **A61P7:00** (\"Drugs for affecting the heart or vascular system\") in the patent data indicates that Atorvastatin is utilized for its therapeutic activity in managing lipid imbalances and impacting the heart or vascular system, which are critical aspects of cardiovascular health.\n\n*   **Overall Landscape:**\n    *   **Manufacturing & Processes:** A significant portion of the patents focuses on the processes for preparing Atorvastatin and its intermediates, emphasizing advancements in its chemical synthesis (e.g., C07D classes).\n    *   **Formulation & Stability:** Patents address the stabilization of Atorvastatin and its incorporation into various pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., A61K classes for different dosage forms), indicating efforts to improve drug shelf-life and delivery.\n    *   **Global Interest:** Inventors and assignees are located across multiple countries (Canada, Israel, Denmark, US, UK, Slovenia), illustrating widespread international research and development in this area.\n    *   **Steady Innovation:** The consistent number of patents filed in 2006, 2008, and 2010 suggests ongoing innovation and strategic patenting activity for Atorvastatin during this period.\n    *   **Environmental Considerations:** A minor but notable trend includes consideration for environmentally friendly production methods, as indicated by the Y02P classification."

  "data": "Based on the provided context, here is a detailed clinical trials report for Atorvastatin:\n\n**Clinical Trials Report for Atorvastatin**\n\n**1. Total Trials:**\nThe provided context describes **3 unique clinical trials** involving Atorvastatin.\n\n**2. Phase Distribution:**\n*   **Phase 4:** 1 trial (NCT00640549 - ALPIN Study)\n*   **Not Specified:** 2 trials (The implicit first trial, and NCT00375518)\n\n**3. Status Distribution:**\n*   **TERMINATED:** 1 trial (NCT00640549). This trial was terminated prematurely due to a higher screening failure rate than expected, not for safety or efficacy reasons.\n*   **COMPLETED:** 1 trial (NCT00375518)\n*   **Not Specified:** 1 trial (The implicit first trial)\n\n**4. Top 5 Sponsors:**\nBased on the identified trials, there are two distinct sponsors:\n1.  Pfizer's Upjohn (merged with Mylan to form Viatris Inc.) - 1 trial (NCT00640549)\n2.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center - 1 trial (NCT00375518)\n(One trial has no sponsor specified in the context.)\n\n**5. Trend over years:**\n*   **2003:** One trial (NCT00640549) started in March.\n*   **2004:** One trial (NCT00640549) completed (terminated) in October.\n*   **2006:** One trial (NCT00375518) started in July and was first posted in September.\n*   **2008:** One trial (NCT00640549) was first posted in March.\n*   **2014:** One trial (NCT00375518) completed in May.\n\n**6. Top Countries:**\nThe provided context **does not contain any information regarding the countries** where these trials were conducted.\n\n**7. Enrollment Analysis:**\n*   **Actual Enrollment: 41 participants** (from NCT00640549).\n*   Enrollment figures are not specified for the other two trials in the provided context.\n\n**8. Clinical Landscape Summary:**\n\nThe clinical trials for Atorvastatin, as described in the context, focus on several aspects related to cardiovascular health and statin use:\n\n*   **Addressing Statin Intolerance and Cardiovascular Disease (Trial 1):** One trial includes participants with a \"Clinical indication for statins for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dyslipidaemia\" who previously withdrew from statins due to perceived side effects. The primary outcome measures mean symptom scores across treatment periods, indicating a focus on patient experience and adherence in the context of cardiovascular risk management.\n*   **Impact on Lipid Subfractions in Diabetes/Hyperlipidemia (NCT00640549):** A Phase 4 study aimed to investigate the effects of Atorvastatin on LDL and HDL subfractions in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. This directly addresses key cardiovascular risk factors. However, this study was terminated prematurely, and no efficacy results are available from it in the context.\n*   **Reduction of Cardiopulmonary Complications Post-Surgery (NCT00375518):** Another trial evaluated Atorvastatin versus placebo to reduce cardiopulmonary complications (like arrhythmias and lung inflammation) after thoracic surgery, suggesting a role in perioperative cardiac and pulmonary protection.\n*   **General Statin Research (Citations):** The context also includes citations for research on statins, one specifically addressing \"Effects of statins on serum n-3 to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios in patients with coronary artery disease,\" further highlighting the broader scientific interest in statins for cardiovascular health.\n\n**How useful is Atorvastatin for cardiovascular diseases?**\n\nBased *only* on the provided context:\n\nAtorvastatin is widely considered for its usefulness in cardiovascular diseases, as evidenced by its application in these trials:\n\n*   It is prescribed for individuals with a \"clinical indication for statins for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dyslipidaemia\" (Trial 1), implying its established role in managing these conditions.\n*   Its investigation into the \"Impact of Atorvastatin on the Distribution, Composition, and Metabolism of LDL and HDL Subfractions\" in patients with hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes (NCT00640549) demonstrates its direct relevance to key cardiovascular risk factors.\n*   The reference to a study on \"Effects of statins on serum n-3 to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios in patients with coronary artery disease\" (citation) further reinforces its role in patients with established coronary artery disease.\n*   Additionally, it is explored for broader cardiovascular benefits, such as reducing \"cardiopulmonary complications after thoracic surgery\" including heart rhythm abnormalities (NCT00375518).\n\nWhile the context describes the *objectives* and *design* of these trials, and implies Atorvastatin's utility through the inclusion criteria and conditions studied, it does not provide *results* or specific efficacy data from these particular trials to quantify \"how useful\" it is. The termination of one key study (NCT00640549) means no efficacy data is available from that specific trial within this context. However, the overarching themes of the trials point to Atorvastatin's use across various facets of cardiovascular disease management and prevention."

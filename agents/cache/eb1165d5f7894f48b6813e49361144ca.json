For the prevention of cardiovascular disease, statins are a first-line treatment in reducing cholesterol. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects may include diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, muscle pain (typically mild and dose-dependent) and, less frequently, joint pain. Muscle symptoms often occur during the first year and are commonly influenced by pre-existing health issues and the nocebo effect. Most patients can continue therapy with dose adjustment or statin switching. Rare (<0.1%) but serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle disorder), liver problems and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Like all statins, atorvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol.\nAtorvastatin was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 115 million prescriptions filled for over 29 million people. In Australia, it was one of the top ten most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.\n\n---\n*Source: Wikipedia - Information retrieved for Atorvastatin*\n"
